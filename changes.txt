7/8/2025 changes to be made

1) Slider to number input for omega_matter and omega_vac
2) Decimal upto 5 to digits for omega_matter and omega_vac
3) observed frequency nu_o and s_nu_o
4) input for l,b,w is in arcsecond on webpage instructions
5) output of length, breadth, depth and volume of lobe in kpc, kpc, kpc and kpc^3.
6) toggle for single source mode and batch source mode
7) to input the total length of the radio galaxies in arcsecond for both lobes seperately
8) to get the output of the total length of source in kpc 
9)* velocity of hotspot

Topic for NTCC Seminar 2: (Future work) to convert magnetic fields and ages from one cosmology to other cosmology


18/12/25 CHANGES  

1) Numbering of equations
2) Write which equation has been replaced where and make it a well documented write up
3) lobes structure model should have two options, one is 1) cylinder mode, other is 2) ellipsoid mode
4) source parameters to be displayed in the display interface
5) in single source mode all the source parameters should be fed manually (alpha gamma1 gamma2 nu0 F_nu0 l b w z) 
6) calculate U_total(min) and U_total(eq) from equation 100. 
7) For the input file, there should be references at the end
8) age of lobe from literature (later if time permits, to be derived by self)
9) Estimation of velocity of hotspot by dividing the distance from core to hotspot by the age of the source
